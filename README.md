# QuantifyMe Django Backend Server

Many health recommendations aren't tuned to a specific individual. Maybe you should sleep 9 hours a night instead of the recommended 8 or walk 8,000 steps a day to be your best. A scientific way to find personalized recommendations and causal links is to conduct experiments using single-case experimental design; however, properly designed single-case experiments are not easy!

The QuantifyMe platform helps researchers conduct single-case experiments in an automated and scientific manner.

More information about the project and lessons learned can be found in our papers:
